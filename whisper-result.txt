    'text': " Let's go over first time setup, first time run through to make sure that all the security permissions on your Mac are going to be okay and allow for this to work because it is being a bot that's pretending to be a human. And so you got to make sure that we allow all the permissions. So the first time you download the script, we'll double click on the stem logic. It opens up the code. Try not to edit any of the code in here. It is editable. If for some reason you do, it probably won't let you save. You can always go back and re-download the script if you mess up the code. So the first time I open it, it's going to open it in an app called Script Editor, which you can see up here in the top left. And then we're going to hit play, but it's not going to work the first time. We'll go through everything that it asks us to do. I'm just going to leave it a song name for now. We'll call it two tracks. Yeah, yeah. Did everything. At the very beginning, let's see. Yep, I get a pop-up. I get an error. Script Editor. System Events got an error. Script Editor is not allowed to send keystrokes. That's going to happen the first time unless you've already done some script editing. So I'm going to hit OK. It didn't work. This pop-up opens System Settings. And then in here, Script Editor is unchecked. We're going to check it. And then I'm going to use my Touch ID, put in your password, whatever. And we should be good to go. so now we're going to quit out of this i will also quit the script editor just to be safe double click it again and now it should be working so with play go through our pre checklist nothing soloed click is off arrangement window song name call two tracks and first track is selected it's going to make those folders on our desktop now and there we go now it's working so now once Once we have those preferences going, you should be good to go. Let's talk about an advanced thing you can do. It's nice so that you don't accidentally change any of the code if you just don't want to see the code. I get that that's a little clunky. If we go to the preferences, go script editor, settings, or hit command comma, and here I was pulled them over here. And we have this script menu, script menu in the menu bar. Then we get this guy up here. And this just allows us to have a dropdown from the top that we can execute these scripts without having to open them. So let's open the folder. Let's open the user folder. That popped onto my other screen. Let me pull it up here. I'm going to hold option, click and drag. That's just going to make a copy. I'm going to do that just for demonstration purposes. And now we should be able to see stem logic in that dropdown menu. We can go ahead and close this finder window, close this guy here. Let's close our preferences. We can just hit STEM logic here. And it's going to ask all of those pre-check questions to make sure everything's going right. The two tracks. And then export. And it will take over. There's a chance. Mine's working. There's a chance that you're going to get those security preferences popping up again. So we'll go deal with that. One thing is I'm not really sure. Can you stop it? Yeah, you can stop it just by clicking up here. cool and it has shows the progress bar because i wanted to cancel so we know it's working if we go back to the preferences i'm just gonna go to spotlight preferences privacy and privacy and security and then we're gonna go to automation and script menu is here you might get that question to allow that so make sure that's allowed and that's just a slightly cleaner way this will will always be up top and you can run stem logic from there happy music making",
